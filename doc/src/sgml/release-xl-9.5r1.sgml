   This release includes all the bug fixes and security fixes from PostgreSQL
9.5.4. In addition, there are a few Postgres-XL specific bug fixes in this
release. For information about new features in the Postgres-XL 9.5r1 major release, see

   <para>
    A dump/restore is not required for those running Postgres-XL 9.5r1.2.
Unfortunately, one commit between Postgres-XL 9.5r1.1 and Postgres-XL 9.5r1.2 has caused breakage for those
upgrading from either Postgres-XL 9.5r1 or Postgres-XL 9.5r1.1 release. We
would encourage a dump/restore if you are upgrading from one of those releases.
Since the breakage is limited to views/rules, you may also try to just dump and
recreate those objects.
   </para>
   <para>
    For those who are running Postgres-XL 9.5r1.2, there is no need for
dump/restore.

      Avoid pushing down evaluation of VALUES clause to a datanode for replicated
tables, unless it contains volatile function(s).
     </para>
     <para>
      This should provide a good performance boost for affected cases by
avoiding another connection, thus reducing connection overhead as well as
latency.

      Use GTM_Sequence type to hold value of a sequence on GTM.
     </para>
     <para>
      We were incorrectly using "int" at couple of places which is not wide
enough to store 64-bit sequence values.
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Never ever use an invalid XID, if we fail to connect to the GTM.
     </para>
     <para>
      Earlier a node would happily proceed further if GTM becomes
dead or unreachable. This may result in random problems since rest of the code
is not prepared to deal with that situation (as seen from the crash in TAP
tests).
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Do not compute the relation size everytime rescanning a relation with
    sequence scan.
     </para>
     <para>
      This can provide big boost to performance when the inner side of a nested
loop has a sequence scan with large number of rows in outer relation.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Block FOR SHARE/UPDATE for queries involving joins
     </para>
     <para>
      Per report from Shaun Thomas, we don't yet support row locking when query
has a join between tables. While it may sometimes give an error, worse it may
silently lock wrong rows leading to application logic failures. The feature is
now blocked until more appropriate fix is available.
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Add several few regression test cases.

     <para>
      Use 2^32 modulo computation to convert signed integer to unsigned value
since abs() may give a different result.
     </para>
     <para>
      This makes the redistribution code in sync with the way hash modulo is
computed elsewhere in the code. Earlier versions may have redistributed
replicated tables wrongly when their distribution strategy is changed to hash
or modulo distribution.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Load balance remote subplan execution by choosing a node randomly instead of
always picking up the first node.
     </para>
     <para>
      When planner has a choice of executing a subplan on any of the remote
nodes, it always used to execute the subplan on the first node. That can cause
excessive load/number of connections on that node. This change fixes that by
choosing a node randomly from the list of available nodes.

     <para>
      Fix a nasty bug that was zeroing out clog and subtrans pages, thus
      causing various sorts of data corruptions.
     </para>
     <para>
      The bug dates back to the XC days, but became prominent in XL because of
      certain recent changes, especially the addition of cluster monitor process. In
      Postgres-XL, a node may not see all the XIDs and hence clog/subtrans log must
      be extended whenever a new XID crosses the previously seen page boundary. We do
      this by comparing the pageno where the new XID maps with the latest_page_no as
      stored in the shared SLRU data structure.  But to handle XID wrap-arounds, we
      added a check for difference in number of pages to be less than
      CLOG_WRAP_CHECK_DELTA, which was incorrectly defined as (2^30 /
              CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE). Note that "^" is a logical XOR operator in C and hence
      this was returned a very small number of 28, thus causing incorrect zeroing of
      pages if ExtendCLOG is called with an XID which is older than what 28 clog
      pages can hold. All such transactions would suddenly be marked as aborted,
      resulting in removal of perfectly valid tuples.
     </para>
     <para>
      This bug is now fixed.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Extend CLOG and Subtrans Log correctly when a new XID is received from
      the remote node.
     </para>
     <para>
      When a datanode assigns an XID for a running transaction, it sends it
      back to the coordinator. If the XID maps to a new CLOG page, it must extend the
      CLOG to include the page. 
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Correct shared memory size calculation for Shared Queue hashtable.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Add a reference count mechanism for Shared Queue management.
     </para>
     <para>
      When a process acquires or binds to a Shared Queue, reference count is
      incremented and decremented when the process releases or unbinds from the
      queue. The new mechanism ensures that the queue is returned to the free list
      once all users have finished their work.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Interprete <varname>shared_queue_size</varname> to be per datanode value.
     </para>
     <para>
      Earlier, each consumer of a shared queue would get
      <varname>shared_queue_size</varname>/<varname>num_consumers</varname> kilobytes
      of shared memory. So the amount of shared memory available to each consumer
      greatly depends on the number of datanodes in the cluster, thus making it
      difficult to choose a default value. So we now treat the
      <varname>shared_queue_size</varname> as a per datanode setting and compute the
      total size by multiplying it with the number of max datanodes as configured by
      <varname>max_datanodes</varname>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Set <varname>shared_queues</varname> to at least 1/4th of
      <varname>max_connections</varname>.
     </para>
     <para>
      This parameter is highly dependent on the number of concurrent sessions
      and in the worst case, every session may use more than one shared queues. While
      the user should set this value high enough depending on the concurrent
      distributed queries, we now automatically set this to at least 1/4th of the
      <varname>max_connections</varname> to avoid running with too small value.
     </para>

      Fix a memory leak in the GTM proxy.

      Properly deallocate prepared statements on the remote node when user makes
      such request.

      Avoid protocol breakage when pooler fails to open connection to one or
      more nodes.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Add a mechanism to selectively refresh pooler information when only
      connection options, such as hostname/port changes for a node.
     </para> 
     <para> 
      This allows us to retain connections to all other nodes in the cluster and
      just recreate connections to the node whose connection information is changed.
      This will be especially handy while dealing with datanode/coordinator failover

   <title>Overview</title>
   <para>
    This major release of <productname>Postgres-XL</productname> comes
almost 2 years after <productname>Postgres-XL</productname> 9.2 was released,
which was based on
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.2. This release includes most of the
new features added in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5
releases. This also includes almost all significant performance enhancements
that were made to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> in the last few years.
   </para>

   <para>
    Apart from this, a lot of work has gone into fixing outstanding bugs,
improving stability of the product and significantly improving performance for OLTP
workloads. The following sections describe the major enhancements in
<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> that are now available in
<productname>Postgres-XL</productname>. A short list of features that are
currently not supported or have limited support is also mentioned in
<xref linkend="major-unsupported-enhancements">.

     Version 9.5r1 contains a number of changes that may affect compatibility
     with previous releases. Since Postgres-XL 9.5r1 release includes all changes
from PostgreSQL 9.3, PostgreSQL 9.4 and PostgreSQL 9.5 releases, it is
recommended that you review respective release notes of those releases to find
the exact incompatibilities.

       <productname>Postgres-XC</productname> has Fast Query Shipping (FQS) feature to fully ship queries that can be safely executed on the remote
       datanodes, without any finalisation at the coordinator. The same feature has
       now been ported to <productname>Postgres-XL</productname>. This improves
       performances for extremely short queries which are now directly planned and
       executed on the datanodes.

      Bump up default value for <varname>sequence_range</varname> to 1000.
       </para>
       <para>
       The earlier default for this GUC was <literal>1</literal>. But performance of <command>INSERT</command> is observed to be extremely poor
   when sequences are incremented by 1. So the default value of this GUC is now bumped up to
   <literal>1000</literal>. This can create holes in the sequence assignment.
   Applications that do not want holes in sequence values should set this GUC to
   <literal>1</literal>.

       </para>
       <para>
        This is a developer GUC and it must be used with caution since its usage can
   lead to inconsistent or wrong query results. In
   <productname>Postgres-XL</productname>, snapshots are normally computed at the
   GTM so that a globally consistent view of the cluster can be obtained. But
   sometimes applications may want to read using a slightly stale snapshot that is
   computed on the coordinator, so that an extra round trip to the GTM is avoided.
   While such snapshots can improve performance, they may give a wrong result,
   especially when more than one coorinators are running.

       select() system call is not well equipped to handle large number of file

       <para>
        In the older release of <productname>Postgres-XL</productname>, every

the database. <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> fixed this problems a few
years back by using <varname>Virtual XIDs</varname>. This release of

completely avoiding XID assignment for <command>SELECT</command> queries and
only assigning them when are really required.
